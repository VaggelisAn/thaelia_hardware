Code for the Hardware of team Thaelia (iGEM Thessaly 2024).
Our project aims to develop a bacterial formulation to protect olive trees from Verticillium dahliae. 
The treatment involves using engineered P. putida to facilitate bacterial-mediated RNA interference (bmRNAi).
To ensure the safety and efficacy of our bacterial system, we developed tools to monitor and test its behaviour under controlled conditions. 
This collaborative effort addresses a fundamental question in biosafety: "How safe is safe?"
